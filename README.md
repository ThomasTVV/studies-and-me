This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## System Requirements

- Node.js 18.17 or later.
- macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.

## Run the app

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Design Considerations

- **Why Next.js?** Next.js makes it easy to make a fast, clean, and reliable webapp in react. Furthermore, it seamlessly implements dynamic routing.
- **Octokit**. Github provides an SDK for interacting with their api called Octokit, which is used in this project, as it enables typescript to automatically infer the types, and it also makes error handling easier.

## Tests

Run tests by:

```bash
npm run test
```
